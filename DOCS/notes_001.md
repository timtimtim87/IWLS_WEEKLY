Project Overview & Setup
Objective: Create a comprehensive IWLS (Iteratively Weighted Least Squares) analysis system using weekly stock data spanning multiple decades, with linear interpolation for smooth visualization.
Key Improvements:

Weekly data instead of daily (enabling decades of historical analysis)
Linear interpolation between actual data points for better plotting
Focus on stock analysis only (no options)
Clean start with better data organization

Phase 1: Project Structure & Data Management
Directory Structure:

/IWLS_WEEKLY/ (your root)
/IWLS_WEEKLY/DATA/ (for raw CSV files - gitignored)
/IWLS_WEEKLY/RESULTS/ (for analysis outputs - gitignored)
/IWLS_WEEKLY/PYTHONS/ (for Python scripts - tracked in git)
/IWLS_WEEKLY/DOCS/ (for documentation - tracked in git)

Git Configuration:

Update .gitignore to exclude all CSV files, data folders, and result folders
Track only Python files, documentation, and configuration files
This mirrors your successful previous project structure

Phase 2: Data Import & Preparation
Data Collection:

Import weekly stock price data (multiple CSV files from your data source)
Each file likely contains: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume for one stock
Target: 20-30+ years of weekly data per stock

Data Merging Strategy:

Create a master merger script that combines all individual stock CSV files
Standardize date formats and ensure consistent weekly intervals
Handle missing data appropriately (gaps, delisted stocks, etc.)
Create a unified dataset with all stocks aligned by date

Linear Interpolation Implementation:

Between actual weekly data points, create interpolated daily values
This gives smooth price curves for visualization while maintaining weekly analytical foundation
Store both: actual weekly values (for analysis) and interpolated daily values (for plotting)

Phase 3: IWLS Analysis Framework
Core IWLS Implementation (adapted from your existing code):

Implement the IWLS regression algorithm for weekly data
Calculate trend lines, deviations, and growth rates
Adapt the lookback periods for weekly data (e.g., 300 weeks instead of 1500 days)
Generate annual growth rates and deviation metrics

Analysis Components:

Individual asset IWLS analysis (trend lines, deviations)
Cross-asset comparison and ranking systems
Time-series analysis of underperformance patterns
Statistical analysis of deviation patterns and mean reversion

Phase 4: Strategy Analysis (Non-Options Focused)
Portfolio Rebalancing Strategies:

Adapt your quintile-based rebalancing approach to weekly data
Test different rebalancing frequencies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual)
Compare concentration vs diversification strategies
Analyze optimal holding periods and profit targets

Performance Analysis:

Benchmark comparisons (SPY, major indices)
Risk-adjusted returns analysis
Drawdown analysis and volatility metrics
Long-term backtesting with decades of data

Phase 5: Visualization & Reporting
Enhanced Visualization:

Leverage interpolated daily data for smooth, professional-looking charts
Multi-decade trend analysis with zoom capabilities
Interactive dashboards showing deviation patterns over time
Performance comparison charts across different time periods

Comprehensive Reporting:

Generate detailed analysis reports for each strategy
Cross-decade performance analysis
Statistical significance testing with larger datasets
Export capabilities for further analysis

Phase 6: Advanced Analysis
Extended Historical Analysis:

Multi-decade pattern recognition
Business cycle correlation analysis
Long-term mean reversion studies
Crisis period behavior analysis (2000 dot-com, 2008 financial, 2020 pandemic, etc.)

Enhanced Strategy Development:

Seasonal rebalancing patterns
Economic indicator integration
Sector rotation strategies based on IWLS patterns
Risk management optimization with longer historical context

Technical Considerations
Data Structure:

Design efficient data structures for handling decades of multi-asset data
Implement memory-efficient processing for large datasets
Create modular code structure for easy expansion

Performance Optimization:

Optimize IWLS calculations for larger datasets
Implement parallel processing where beneficial
Create checkpointing for long-running analyses

Quality Assurance:

Implement data validation checks
Create unit tests for IWLS calculations
Validate against your existing daily analysis results where they overlap

Expected Outcomes
Enhanced Analysis Capabilities:

20-30+ years of backtesting data vs. current 10 years
More statistically significant results due to larger sample sizes
Better understanding of long-term mean reversion patterns
Ability to test strategies across multiple market cycles

Professional Implementation:

Clean, modular codebase suitable for GitHub
Comprehensive documentation and reproducible results
Scalable architecture for future enhancements
Professional-quality visualizations with interpolated data

This plan builds on your successful existing framework while addressing the key limitations (short time horizon, daily data constraints) and providing a solid foundation for decades of comprehensive stock market analysis.
